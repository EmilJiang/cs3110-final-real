# Installation Steps:

Notes: 
- This program requires python3 with version 3.11 (NOT 3.12) to be installed. 
  - You can switch python versions by using a python manager such as pyenv, or 
    installing 3.11 on your computer if it isn't already installed.
- Step 6 (putting in the API key) must be completed before dune test can be run

1. Navigate to the cs3110-final-real (root) folder in terminal

2. Type in "opam install pyml raylib raygui ppx_inline_test" (and continue with "Y")

3. Type in the following three commands to terminal:

python3 -m venv venv 
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install openai

6. Go to APIKEY.txt and copy the key to lib/question.ml on line 67, in the empty ""
- For clarification, it should be in the empty quotations in (Py.String.of_string "");

7. Type in "dune exec bin/main.exe" into the terminal
